Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology working with <a href="http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Prof. Irfan Essa</a> and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/" target="blank">Prof. Sehoon Ha</a>. 

The goal of my research is to teach embodied agents exploration strategies that improve their understanding of objects around them. See my [Projects](/projects/)/[Publications](/publications/){:target="_blank"}/[CV](/assets/pdf/K_Niranjan_Kumar_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more information. 

I am in the job market for post-doc and industry research roles in robotics. Please reach out to me if you have any opportunities.
