I’m a fourth year PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology working with [Prof. Irfan Essa](http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/). Before starting my PhD, I was a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Gatech and worked at the OLIVES lab with [Prof. Ghassan](https://ghassanalregib.info/team).

My goal of my current research is to model aspects of human cognition into robots to make them learn and reason about the world around them. See my [Projects](/al-folio/projects/)/[Publications](/al-folio/publications/) for more information
