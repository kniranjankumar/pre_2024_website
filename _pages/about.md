I’m a fourth year PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology working with <a href=http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/ target="blank">Prof. Irfan Essa</a>. Before starting my PhD, I was a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Gatech and worked at the OLIVES lab with <a href="https://ghassanalregib.info/" target="blank">Prof. Ghassan AlRegib</a>.

The goal of my research is to build embodied agents that learn manipulation policies to improve their understanding of objects around them.
