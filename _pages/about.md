I’m a PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology working with <a href="http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Prof. Irfan Essa</a> and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/" target="blank">Prof. Sehoon Ha</a>. Before starting my PhD, I was a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Gatech and worked at the OLIVES lab with <a href="https://ghassanalregib.info/" target="blank">Prof. Ghassan AlRegib</a>.

The goal of my research is to teach embodied agents exploration strategies that improve their understanding of objects around them.
